      <title>ICE Rounds Up 300 California Farmworkers, One Dies: Eyewitness and Oxnard Mayor Respond</title>
      <link>http://www.democracynow.org/2025/7/14/los_angeles</link>
      <description>An immigration raid in Camarillo, California, on Thursday led to an hourslong standoff between protesters and federal border agents, who blocked the roads with military-style vehicles and tear-gassed community members, including children, as crowds attempted to protect dozens of farmworkers from arrest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department of Homeland Security said over 300 immigrants were detained in dual raids on cannabis farms and agricultural fields in Camarillo and the coastal city of Carpinteria. One farmworker fell from the roof of a greenhouse during the immigration raid and later died of his injuries. Jaime Alanís, 57, had worked at the farm in Camarillo for 10 years and provided for his wife and daughter who live in Mexico. Alanís is the first known person to die during an immigration raid since President Trump returned to office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It was almost unlike anything that we had ever seen before,&amp;#8221; says Angelmarie Taylor, a&lt;br /&gt;
student and volunteer with 805 Immigrant Coalition who was present during the raid in Camarillo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;re talking about human beings. We&amp;#8217;re talking about parents, just like the gentleman that passed because of the chaotic actions of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ICE&lt;/span&gt;,&amp;#8221; says Luis McArthur, mayor of nearby Oxnard.</description>

      <title>Netanyahu Had Ceasefire Deal in April 2024 But Kept Gaza War Going to Stay in Power: NY Times</title>
      <link>http://www.democracynow.org/2025/7/14/israel</link>
      <description>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected ceasefire deals and other chances to deescalate the devastating war in Gaza and beyond, all to remain in power and avoid corruption charges, according to a new investigation in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times Magazine&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;#8220;Netanyahu put the integrity of the coalition, the safety of his continuous rule of the government and the state … as a first priority ahead of any other priority,&amp;#8221; says Ronen Bergman, Pulitzer Prize-winning Israeli investigative reporter.</description>

      <title>"War on Children": Doctor in Gaza on Massacres, Starvation and Israel's Plan for Concentration Camps</title>
      <link>http://www.democracynow.org/2025/7/14/gaza</link>
      <description>The official death toll in Gaza has topped 58,000, with Israeli forces continuing to shoot at Palestinians seeking aid and talks over a ceasefire agreement stalled in Doha. This morning&amp;#8217;s injured were taken to Nasser Hospital, the largest functioning hospital in Gaza, facing fuel shortages and a widening Israeli offensive in the area. &lt;em&gt;Democracy Now!&lt;/em&gt; spoke with Dr. Tarek Loubani, an emergency room medical doctor who has been volunteering in Nasser Hospital in Gaza since June, live from Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Every day seems to be a new exercise in the depths of human depravity in terms of targeting men, boys, women and children, especially in terms of the youngest children,&amp;#8221; says Loubani. &amp;#8220;I think every doctor who operates and works in Palestine will tell you that that&amp;#8217;s the most jarring, the most terrible part of our job, is just the war on children on every level.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <title>Judge Blocks Trump Birthright Citizenship Order; DOJ Caught Lying About Men Sent to El Salvador</title>
      <link>http://www.democracynow.org/2025/7/11/birthright_citizenship_class_action_lee_gelernt</link>
      <description>A federal judge in New Hampshire has issued a nationwide injunction against President Trump&amp;#8217;s executive order ending birthright citizenship for children born in the United States since February 20. In a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of immigrant parents, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACLU&lt;/span&gt; argued that the order would leave children born to undocumented parents &amp;#8220;effectively stateless.&amp;#8221; We speak to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACLU&lt;/span&gt; attorney Lee Gelernt about the case, which he calls &amp;#8220;cruel&amp;#8221; and without merit, as well as new evidence that the Trump administration is lying about its power over people it has expelled to the Salvadoran mega-prison &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CECOT&lt;/span&gt;.</description>

      <title>Ex-NOAA Official on TX Flood: Trump Breaking "Disaster Response Chain" as Climate Crisis Escalates</title>
      <link>http://www.democracynow.org/2025/7/11/monica_medina_tx_flooding</link>
      <description>Rescue teams in central Texas are still searching for about 160 people who went missing in the catastrophic flash floods on July 4. The official death toll has climbed to at least 121 victims. State policymakers are now in the spotlight, as questions swirl around Texas&amp;#8217;s lack of emergency precautions and the climate denialism of Republican political leaders. &amp;#8220;Many of those lost lives could have been saved if links in our disaster response chain hadn&amp;#8217;t been broken,&amp;#8221; says Monica Medina, a former official at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the federal administration that, among other tasks, monitors extreme weather. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOAA&lt;/span&gt; has been hit by major cuts to funding and staffing under Trump, despite the increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters from climate change. Medina is among many climate and policy experts sounding the alarm on the defunding of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOAA&lt;/span&gt; and other meteorological and disaster preparedness services. &amp;#8220;We are firing the people. We&amp;#8217;re stopping taking in the data. We&amp;#8217;re ending the research. We&amp;#8217;re turning off the satellites. We&amp;#8217;re doing everything we possibly can to put our heads in the sand in the midst of what is increasingly dangerous weather.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <title>"Economy of Genocide": U.S. Sanctions U.N. Expert Who Reports on Corporate Profits from Israel's Gaza War</title>
      <link>http://www.democracynow.org/2025/7/10/francesca_albanese_sanctions</link>
      <description>We speak with United Nations expert Francesca Albanese, one day after the Trump administration announced it is imposing sanctions on her over her advocacy for Palestinian rights. Albanese has served as the U.N. special rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian Territory since 2022. She recently released a report highlighting dozens of companies aiding Israel&amp;#8217;s occupation of Palestinian territory and fueling its genocidal war machine in Gaza, including U.S. tech giants. Secretary of State Marco Rubio characterized Albanese&amp;#8217;s work as &amp;#8220;political and economic warfare&amp;#8221; against the United States and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It seems that this administration is quite allergic to justice,&amp;#8221; says Albanese, speaking to &lt;em&gt;Democracy Now!&lt;/em&gt; from Slovenia. &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s trying to distract us from where our focus should be: What&amp;#8217;s happening to the Palestinians in the little that remains of their tormented land, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and East Jerusalem.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <title>"Apocalypse in the Tropics": Brazilian Filmmaker on Evangelicals, Bolsonaro &amp; Trump's Tariff Threat</title>
      <link>http://www.democracynow.org/2025/7/10/apocalypse_in_the_tropics_petra_costa</link>
      <description>Brazilian filmmaker Petra Costa&amp;#8217;s latest documentary, &lt;em&gt;Apocalypse in the Tropics&lt;/em&gt;, explores the impact of evangelical Christianity on Brazil&amp;#8217;s political landscape. Once a small minority, evangelicals now constitute about 30% of Brazil&amp;#8217;s population and played a key role in the rise of former far-right President Jair Bolsonaro. &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s one of the fastest-growing religious shifts in the history of mankind,&amp;#8221; Costa tells &lt;em&gt;Democracy Now!&lt;/em&gt; She says right-wing evangelicalism in Brazil is largely a U.S. import, after Washington sought to undermine the influence of left-wing Catholic teachings during the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday threatened to impose 50% tariffs on Brazil, partly as retribution for what he calls the &amp;#8220;witch hunt&amp;#8221; against Bolsonaro, now facing trial in Brazil for an alleged coup attempt following his defeat in the 2022 presidential election to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apocalypse in the Tropics&lt;/em&gt; is available on Netflix starting July 14. Costa&amp;#8217;s previous film, &lt;em&gt;The Edge of Democracy&lt;/em&gt;, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.</description>

      <title>From Agents on Horseback in L.A. to a Chicago Arts Festival, Latino Communities Mobilize Against ICE</title>
      <link>http://www.democracynow.org/2025/7/10/national_museum_of_puerto_rican_arts</link>
      <description>The Trump administration&amp;#8217;s immigration crackdown is sowing fear and chaos in communities across the United States, as heavily armed and masked agents descend on workplaces, schools and public spaces. In Los Angeles, dozens of federal agents, including some on horseback, swept MacArthur Park, located in a predominantly immigrant and working-class part of the city. &amp;#8220;It felt like an occupation of L.A.,&amp;#8221; says Vladimir Carrasco, who works with the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHIRLA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, community leaders in Chicago are expressing outrage after federal immigration forces showed up at the National Museum of Puerto Rican Arts and Culture and refused to identify themselves. Although Homeland Security later claimed the agents were at the museum on an unrelated matter, &amp;#8220;We know that they were there to intimidate us,&amp;#8221; says Veronica Ocasio, director of education and programming at the organization. Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens.</description>

      <title>Philadelphia Strike Ends: Race &amp; Inequality at Center of Municipal Workers' Fight for a Fair Wage</title>
      <link>http://www.democracynow.org/2025/7/9/philly_strike</link>
      <description>The largest municipal workers&amp;#8217; strike in decades in the city of Philadelphia has ended after 9,000 members of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AFSCME&lt;/span&gt; District Council 33, who are primarily sanitation workers, walked off the job a week ago. Growing piles of trash on the streets of Philadelphia brought the strike into clear view for city residents. Labor historian Francis Ryan says the workers won &amp;#8220;the hearts of a lot of Philadelphians&amp;#8221; with a popular social media campaign. &amp;#8220;What I saw on the picket lines last week was a spark of social justice unionism,&amp;#8221; says Ryan. The average sanitation worker salary in Philadelphia is currently $46,000 a year, which the union has argued is not a living wage for workers required to live within the city limits.</description>

      <title>"Ideological Deportation": AAUP v. Rubio Trial Challenges Trump Crackdown on Pro-Palestine Students</title>
      <link>http://www.democracynow.org/2025/7/9/aaup</link>
      <description>The first trial in a case challenging the Trump administration&amp;#8217;s policy of detaining and deporting international students and professors who participate in pro-Palestinian activism is underway in Boston. The American Association of University Professors and the Middle East Studies Association brought the lawsuit. Government lawyers tried to get it dismissed, but U.S. District Judge William Young, an 84-year-old Ronald Reagan nominee, ordered a trial, saying it was the &amp;#8220;best way to get at truth.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Students and faculty all over the country are quite literally terrified about the possibility that their advocacy and expression will lead to detention,&amp;#8221; says Jameel Jaffer, director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University and one of the lawyers challenging the Trump administration. &amp;#8220;They are terrified that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ICE&lt;/span&gt; agents will show up at their door any day and take them away.&amp;#8221;</description>

The American Association of University Professors and the Middle East Studies Association brought the lawsuit. Government lawyers tried to get it dismissed, but U.S. District Judge William Young, an 84-year-old Ronald Reagan nominee, ordered a trial, saying it was the &#8220;best way to get at truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Students and faculty all over the country are quite literally terrified about the possibility that their advocacy and expression will lead to detention,&#8221; says Jameel Jaffer, director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University and one of the lawyers challenging the Trump administration. &#8220;They are terrified that <span class="caps">ICE</span> agents will show up at their door any day and take them away.&#8221;</p>]]>

      <title>"Vladimir Putin Is Not Interested in a Peace Deal": Matt Duss on Trump's Stalled Ukraine Diplomacy</title>
      <link>http://www.democracynow.org/2025/7/9/ukraine_russia</link>
      <description>Ukraine&amp;#8217;s Air Force says Russia launched its largest aerial attack overnight since its 2022 full-scale invasion, firing a record 741 drones and missiles, most of them targeting the city of Lutsk in western Ukraine. The barrage prompted Poland to activate its air defenses and scramble fighter jets. Russia&amp;#8217;s attack came after President Trump on Tuesday sharply criticized Vladimir Putin in his latest in a series of U-turns on Ukraine policy. We speak with Matt Duss, executive vice president at the Center for International Policy and former foreign policy adviser to Senator Bernie Sanders, on the latest developments. Trump is &amp;#8220;learning that it&amp;#8217;s actually not that easy,&amp;#8221; he says. &amp;#8220;And it&amp;#8217;s not that easy because Vladimir Putin is not interested in a peace deal.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <title>"Netanyahu Is the Problem": Sanders's Former Adviser Matt Duss on Why Gaza Ceasefire Remains Elusive</title>
      <link>http://www.democracynow.org/2025/7/9/netanyahu_trump</link>
      <description>President Trump met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House for a second straight day Tuesday, as Trump&amp;#8217;s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, claimed Israel and Hamas were nearing a breakthrough on a ceasefire agreement. Israeli media are reporting Netanyahu is under &amp;#8220;extreme&amp;#8221; pressure to reach a 60-day ceasefire deal, but Netanyahu&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;interests and the interests of his government remain to make this a perpetual, ongoing war,&amp;#8221; says Matt Duss, executive vice president at the Center for International Policy. The U.S.-Israeli proposal would see 10 living Israeli hostages released, along with the bodies of deceased hostages, in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. Hamas negotiators are also seeking the withdrawal of Israeli forces, guarantees for an end to the war, the resumption of humanitarian aid shipments overseen by the U.N. and the International Committee of the Red Cross, and an end to the operations of the so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.</description>

      <title>What Is the Trump Doctrine? John Bellamy Foster on U.S. Foreign Policy &amp; the "New MAGA Imperialism"</title>
      <link>http://www.democracynow.org/2025/7/8/trump_doctrine_maga_imperialism</link>
      <description>What is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MAGA&lt;/span&gt; imperialism? &lt;em&gt;Monthly Review&lt;/em&gt; editor John Bellamy Foster says that, despite its feints toward anti-imperialist isolationism, President Donald Trump&amp;#8217;s foreign policy has coalesced into a &amp;#8220;hyper-nationalist&amp;#8221; form of populism that rejects the U.S.&amp;#39;s post-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WWII&lt;/span&gt; adherence to liberal internationalism and promotes dominance over other countries via military power rather than through economic globalization. Foster explains that this &amp;#8220;Trump doctrine is opposed to multi-ethnic empires and multi-ethnic nations,&amp;#8221; operating under a &amp;#8220;racial definition of foreign policy, with the notion that the United States is a white country and other ethnicities don&amp;#39;t belong.&amp;#8221; And while some analyses of the Trump coalition locate its base in the &amp;#8220;white working class,&amp;#8221; in reality this ideology is rooted in the lower middle class, which owns more property and is less opposed to the wealthy capitalist class. &amp;#8220;If you go back to the 1930s, to Italy and Germany, it&amp;#8217;s the same constituency that drove the fascist movement, but it&amp;#8217;s a result of an alliance between big capital … and the lower middle class.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <title>Peter Beinart on Zohran Mamdani &amp; Why Democratic Voters Are Increasingly Skeptical of Israel</title>
      <link>http://www.democracynow.org/2025/7/8/peter_beinart_nyt_mamdani</link>
      <description>We speak to Peter Beinart, editor-at-large at &lt;em&gt;Jewish Currents&lt;/em&gt;, about changing popular opinion in the U.S. toward Israel and Palestine. &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m not sure there&amp;#8217;s any political issue in the United States, perhaps other than gay marriage, over the last couple of decades where public opinion has shifted as fast,&amp;#8221; he says, citing the surprise victory of pro-Palestinian mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani in New York City&amp;#8217;s Democratic primary as evidence of a shifting political landscape. We also discuss a recent article in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; that criticizes Mamdani, a Ugandan-born Indian Muslim who immigrated to the U.S. as a child, for self-identifying as both Asian and Black/African American on a college application. Beinart, whose own parents are of European Jewish background and were raised in multiracial South Africa, explains how the limitations of formal racial categories often elide the true complexity of racial, ethnic and national identity. &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s not the case that Zohran Mamdani was trying to pull some sleight of hand to try to take advantage of affirmative action. This was a very deep statement about what he believed it was to have grown up in Uganda,&amp;#8221; he says.</description>

      <title>"Freedom to Choose"?: Peter Beinart Slams Trump-Netanyahu Plan for Ethnic Cleansing of Gaza</title>
      <link>http://www.democracynow.org/2025/7/8/peter_beinart</link>
      <description>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump this week in Washington, D.C. Trump and Netanyahu are discussing Israel&amp;#8217;s war in Gaza, with Netanyahu suggesting that new plans for the forced relocation of refugees to other countries would give Palestinians the &amp;#8220;freedom&amp;#8221; to choose. But what Palestinians actually want is &amp;#8220;the freedom to return to the places from which their families were expelled,&amp;#8221; says Peter Beinart, editor-at-large at &lt;em&gt;Jewish Currents&lt;/em&gt; and the author of &lt;em&gt;Being Jewish After the Destruction of Gaza&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;#8220;What kind of freedom is it when you have an area where most of the buildings and the hospitals and the schools and the bakeries and the agriculture have all been destroyed, where you have more child amputees than any other place on Earth?&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>&amp;#8220;The most important thing that we have to do right now is hold the Republicans that voted for this bill accountable for the devastation that they are causing and the lives that will be impacted.&amp;#8221; Democratic Congressmember Yassamin Ansari of Arizona explains how Trump&amp;#8217;s new federal budget, which introduces major cuts to Medicaid, food assistance, housing and education, will worsen wealth inequality and the health disparities, while actually increasing the U.S. deficit by trillions of dollars and supercharging spending for immigration and border enforcement. The congressmember shares her recent experience visiting a detention center outside of Phoenix, calling some of the conditions there the most &amp;#8220;dehumanizing&amp;#8221; she has ever seen. Ansari, the first Iranian American Democrat to serve as a member of Congress, also condemns the Trump administration&amp;#8217;s strikes on Iran in June. &amp;#8220;I do not believe that the president of the United States should be conducting unilateral military action without authorization from Congress,&amp;#8221; she says.</description>

      <title>"Completely Illegal": Dr. Feroze Sidhwa on Israel's "Outrageous" Attacks on Gaza Hospitals &amp; Staff</title>
      <link>http://www.democracynow.org/2025/7/7/israel_war_crimes_hospital</link>
      <description>As Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visits the White House on Monday to discuss a possible new ceasefire in Gaza, we speak with Dr. Feroze Sidhwa about the humanitarian disaster in the Palestinian territory, where Israel has damaged or destroyed much of the health infrastructure since the start of the war in October 2023. Sidhwa is a trauma surgeon in California who volunteered at Nasser Hospital in Gaza. He says Israel&amp;#8217;s impunity in attacking hospitals across Gaza is &amp;#8220;outrageous behavior&amp;#8221; that blatantly violates the rules of war. &amp;#8220;Literally every attack on a healthcare facility in Gaza has been justified by … a willful misunderstanding of international law or just outright lies.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <title>"Frontal Assault" on Climate Justice: Rolling Stone's Antonia Juhasz on Trump's Budget Law</title>
      <link>http://www.democracynow.org/2025/7/7/trump_bill_climate_crisis</link>
      <description>We speak with investigative journalist Antonia Juhasz about how President Trump&amp;#8217;s major tax and spending bill hurts environmental justice efforts in Louisiana communities affected by the climate crisis and pollution from oil and gas facilities. The Trump administration had already canceled much of the funding for local environmental monitoring and advocacy, and the so-called Big, Beautiful Bill further entrenches the power of the fossil fuel industry. &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s a frontal assault on environmental and climate justice, and it will set us back significantly unless we take action to confront the climate crisis,&amp;#8221; says Juhasz, who wrote about the bill&amp;#8217;s impact for &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

      <title>"Most Massive Transfer of Wealth Upward in American History": John Nichols on Trump's Budget Law</title>
      <link>http://www.democracynow.org/2025/7/7/trump_spending_bill</link>
      <description>President Donald Trump and his allies are celebrating the passage of his sweeping  tax and spending bill, which he signed into law on July 4 after a monthslong effort to shepherd it through Congress. Ultimately, just three Republicans in the Senate and two in the House voted against the legislation. The so-called Big, Beautiful Bill includes about $1 trillion in federal cuts to Medicaid and could kick 17 million people off their healthcare. It makes the largest-ever cuts to food assistance benefits, could cause the closure of nursing homes and rural hospitals across the country, raises housing and energy costs, and supercharges the Trump crackdown on immigrants — all while delivering massive tax benefits for the wealthiest people in the country. &amp;#8220;This is the most massive transfer of wealth upward in American history,&amp;#8221; says John Nichols, national affairs correspondent for &lt;em&gt;The Nation&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

      <title>Texas Flood Kills 82+, Including 28 Kids, Amid Drought, Trump Cuts to Weather Service, NOAA &amp; FEMA</title>
      <link>http://www.democracynow.org/2025/7/7/texas_floods</link>
      <description>At least 82 people have died and dozens are still unaccounted for after flash flooding in central Texas over the weekend, when the Guadalupe River rose about 26 feet in less than an hour on Friday amid torrential downpours. At least 10 girls who attended Camp Mystic, a girls&amp;#8217; summer camp located on the banks of the river, are among the missing. In Kerr County, the most devastated area, at least 40 adults and 28 children have died. The speed and scale of the natural disaster has raised questions about why officials weren&amp;#8217;t better prepared, and whether the Trump administration&amp;#8217;s cuts to scientific positions exacerbated the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The National Weather Service, like a lot of federal agencies, went through significant loss of staff back in the spring,&amp;#8221; says retired &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOAA&lt;/span&gt; meteorologist Alan Gerard, now the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt; of Balanced Weather, which provides critical weather and climate alerts. Gerard says that while it appears there was appropriate staffing ahead of the Texas flood, the impact of current budget cuts and even deeper reductions being considered by the administration are a cause for concern. &amp;#8220;We still have all of hurricane season to deal with,&amp;#8221; he says.</description>

On July 5, 1852, in Rochester, New York, Douglass gave one of his most famous speeches, &amp;#8220;What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?&amp;#8221; He was addressing the Rochester Ladies&amp;#8217; Anti-Slavery Society.

      <title>GOP Budget Bill Slashes Medicaid for Millions, Cuts Taxes for the Rich, Funds ICE at Historic Levels</title>
      <link>http://www.democracynow.org/2025/7/3/trump_budget</link>
      <description>As we broadcast, the House was soon set to vote on the so-called big, beautiful bill before the July 4 deadline imposed by President Trump. Should the House pass the legislation, the bill would be sent to Trump&amp;#8217;s desk to be signed into law. The bill massively increases funding for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ICE&lt;/span&gt;, cuts $1 trillion from Medicaid over a decade and adds $3.3 trillion to the nation&amp;#8217;s debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It makes people in the country who are in the bottom 30%, working hard to pay their bills, poorer, because it&amp;#8217;s stripping away healthcare from them, stripping away food assistance from them. And it is all in the name of giving tax breaks to the wealthiest. … The top 20% in this country get 60% of the benefits,&amp;#8221; says Democratic Congressmember Ro Khanna.</description>

      <title>EXCLUSIVE: Mahmoud Khalil, Palestinian Activist Jailed by ICE for 104 Days, in First Live Interview</title>
      <link>http://www.democracynow.org/2025/7/3/mahmoud_khalil</link>
      <description>In his first live broadcast interview since being released from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ICE&lt;/span&gt; detention, Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil tells &lt;em&gt;Democracy Now!&lt;/em&gt; about his experience behind bars, the ongoing threat of deportation that hangs over him and why he continues to speak out against the U.S.-backed Israeli war on Gaza. The Columbia University graduate was the first pro-Palestinian campus protester to be jailed by the Trump administration. Khalil is now reunited with his wife Noor and newborn son Deen, after he was released on bail last month by a federal judge. Khalil says the Trump administration&amp;#8217;s attempts to silence him are &amp;#8220;a distraction from the genocide in Palestine.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <title>"Arrest Now, Ask Questions Later": Why Did L.A. ICE Agents Arrest and Jail U.S. Citizen Andrea Velez?</title>
      <link>http://www.democracynow.org/2025/7/2/ice_abductions_masked_men_andrea_velez</link>
      <description>In an effort to fulfill the Trump administration&amp;#8217;s daily immigration arrest &amp;#8220;quotas,&amp;#8221; federal agents and deputized local law enforcement are racially profiling and snatching people off the streets without due process. These arrests, carried out by armed and masked agents, are sowing terror and confusion in communities across the United States. Stephano Medina, a lawyer with the California Center for Movement Legal Services, shares how &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ICE&lt;/span&gt; regularly denies that it has taken people into custody, leading to family members scrambling for information about their loved ones. &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s arrest now, ask questions later,&amp;#8221; adds Dominique Boubion, an attorney representing Andrea Velez, a U.S. citizen who was taken by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ICE&lt;/span&gt; last month in what Velez has since described as a &amp;#8220;kidnapping.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <title>"Alligator Alcatraz": Florida Activists Resist Everglades Migrant Jail as ICE Deaths Rise in U.S.</title>
      <link>http://www.democracynow.org/2025/7/2/ice_jail_alligator_alcatraz_florida</link>
      <description>Deep in the Florida Everglades, at an abandoned airfield surrounded by barren swampland, local law enforcement authorities are opening the doors to a huge tent facility that hopes to lock up immigrants swept up in the Trump administration&amp;#8217;s mass deportation machine. Republicans have branded the still-unapproved facility &amp;#8220;Alligator Alcatraz,&amp;#8221; with Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier boasting that the state can afford to keep staff and safety costs low because the wild animals of the swamp will provide security and prevent escapes. Immigrant rights advocates warn that the cramped facility will further isolate immigrants who are being rounded up indiscriminately and detained without charge, and could lead to life-threatening overheating and overcrowding. We speak to Nery Lopez of Detention Watch Network and Aaron Reichlin-Melnick of the American Immigration Council for more about the &amp;#8220;inhumane&amp;#8221; proposed detention camp.</description>

      <link>http://www.democracynow.org/2025/7/2/trump_budget_bill_ice_immigration_enforcement</link>
      <description>The budget bill just passed by the Senate provides more than $170 billion in new funding for immigration enforcement and detention. Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, who worked on an analysis published by the American Immigration Council, says the new budget would make &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ICE&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8220;the single largest federal law enforcement agency in the history of the nation.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <title>"Not a Done Deal": After Senate Passes "Big, Ugly Bill," Progressives Fight to Stop It in the House</title>
      <link>http://www.democracynow.org/2025/7/2/trump_big_beautiful_bill_indivisible</link>
      <description>After a contentious round of last-minute negotiations, President Trump&amp;#8217;s budget bill has passed in the Senate, squeaking by thanks to Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote. Three Republicans joined Senate Democrats in voting &amp;#8220;no&amp;#8221; on the bill, which gives tax cuts to the rich and makes historic cuts to Medicaid and food assistance. The bill now heads to the House of Representatives, where Republicans hold a slim majority, for a final vote before Trump&amp;#8217;s July 4 deadline. Citizen groups, including the grassroots political organization ⁠Indivisible⁠, are calling on Americans, particularly those living in Republican and swing districts, to contact their House representatives and urge them to vote against the bill. &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s not a done deal,&amp;#8221; says Indivisible&amp;#8217;s co-founder and co-executive director Ezra Levin. &amp;#8220;They do not have the votes.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>A heat wave is raising temperatures to dangerous levels across much of Europe, just days after a heat wave in North America saw over 3,000 temperature records set. For more, we speak with climate scientist Michael Mann, who warns that heat domes and flooding have nearly tripled since the 1950s. &amp;#8220;At some level, this isn&amp;#8217;t that complicated. You make the planet hotter, you&amp;#8217;re going to have more frequent and intense heat extremes,&amp;#8221; says Mann, a professor of environmental science at the University of Pennsylvania. Mann&amp;#8217;s upcoming book, co-authored with vaccine expert Dr. Peter Hotez, is &lt;em&gt;Science Under Siege: How to Fight the Five Most Powerful Forces That Threaten Our World&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

      <title>"Ethnic Cleansing": U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, on Israel's War in Gaza</title>
      <link>http://www.democracynow.org/2025/7/1/united_nations_human_rights_council_gaza</link>
      <description>&amp;#8220;There are many things that happened in this war that are clearly war crimes,&amp;#8221; Volker Türk, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, says about Israel&amp;#8217;s war on Gaza. &lt;em&gt;Democracy Now!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#39;s Amy Goodman spoke with the top U.N. rights watchdog in Geneva this week at the headquarters of the United Nations Human Rights Council. Türk, who has characterized Israel&amp;#39;s actions in Gaza as ethnic cleansing, discusses the ongoing suffering of the civilian population, how Israel has attacked the U.N. and its workers, and why he continues to hope &amp;#8220;for both Israelis and Palestinians to live side by side in peace.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <title>"Trying to Find Food Is a Death Sentence": Palestinian Writer Muhammad Shehada on Gaza Aid Massacres</title>
      <link>http://www.democracynow.org/2025/7/1/gaza_israel_iran</link>
      <description>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is visiting the United States next week to meet with President Donald Trump and other top officials in the U.S. administration, supposedly to &amp;#8220;capitalize on the success&amp;#8221; of the 12-day war against Iran. This comes after nearly 21 months of Israel&amp;#8217;s war on Gaza that has killed at least 56,000 Palestinians, with daily violence only increasing. &amp;#8220;There&amp;#8217;s basically an airstrike every other minute,&amp;#8221; says Palestinian writer and analyst Muhammad Shehada. &amp;#8220;There&amp;#8217;s nonstop artillery fire, gunfire, machine gunfire, as well as Israeli quadcopter drones that are swarming Gaza and shooting people at random.&amp;#8221; While there have been news reports of a possible ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, Shehada says &amp;#8220;there are no negotiations,&amp;#8221; and therefore no end in sight to the daily bloodshed.</description>

      <title>"Worst Thing I've Ever Seen": U.S. Surgeon Describes Mass Starvation, Injury and Death in Gaza</title>
      <link>http://www.democracynow.org/2025/7/1/al_baqa_cafe_gaza</link>
      <description>We speak with American neurosurgeon Dr. Abdul Basit Khan in Gaza, where he is volunteering at the Nasser Hospital. He describes treating patients with blast injuries and gunshot wounds from Israeli attacks, all while coping with a lack of basic medical supplies and widespread hunger. &amp;#8220;Food insecurity is rampant, from all levels of society. Even the physicians are not eating,&amp;#8221; he says. Multiple blasts were heard during the interview, with Dr. Khan describing his patients as people &amp;#8220;living in tents being indiscriminately bombed&amp;#8221; by Israeli forces. &amp;#8220;This is the worst thing I&amp;#8217;ve ever seen in my entire life, by far.&amp;#8221;</description>
